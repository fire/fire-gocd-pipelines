Fork this repository and use as a "Config Repository" in GoCD.

Note: You will need to edit the `godot_tools_pipeline_export` call
in `jsonnet/godot.jsonnet` and change the `groups_git` repository to
your own Godot application, as that url is currently in development.

See a tutorial here for creating a K3S cluster with GoCD installed,
as well as a full docker deployment pipeline for a backend application.
